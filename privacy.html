          <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

          <p>Hello! This is where we keep our Privacy Policy.</p>

          <p>Our Privacy Policy was last updated on June 15th, 2016</p>

          <h2>About us:</h2>

          <p>At Eezy, this website (kidrec.com) is just for every one and our app KidREC are designed for the whole family, including young children with parent supervision. We take privacy seriously at Eezy and this policy is designed to share what information we collect and how we use it.</p>
          <p>We last updated the contents of this policy on June 15th, 2016. Eezy may change or update the Privacy Policy at any time as we add new or different features, or as the law changes. Unless another date is given, the changes are effective upon posting. Thus, you should review the Privacy Policy frequently. This Privacy Policy is also part of the Terms of Service that explain your rights and responsibilities and Eezy’s when using Eezy’s services and sites. If you don’t agree with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, you should not use the sites and services. If you have any questions please contact us at privacy@kidrec.com.</p>


          <h2>What Kind of Information is Collected?</h2>

          <p>There are two types of data that may be collected. The first one is called personal data. This is personally identifiable information that identifies a user as an individual. Eezy does not collect personal data in any of its kids apps without parental consent. Eezy may collect personal data that parents voluntarily provide on the website. The second type is non personal data which doesn’t directly identify an individual or which may have been personal information but has had the personally identifiable information removed. Eezy may collect non personal information about the use of the website and apps to help us improve our services.</p>

          <h2>More about Personal Data</h2>

          <p>We collect personal data when a parent makes a purchase through our online store, subscribes to a newsletter or alert, submits content to a forum or blog, or requests technical support. This data may include a name (screen or nickname), gender, birth date, email address, mailing or shipping address, telephone number, and payment information. This information may be used to provide services and the sites to you, to process and fulfill your orders, to contact parents about their orders and new services and features and to send push notifications if consent to receive them has been given. If you contact us for help we will only use your email address to reply to your question.</p>
          <p>Please note that if a parent posts personal information about themselves in a community forum or blog in the parent section, in addition to being collected, this data is made public for others to see. The parent is responsible for the disclosure of any such data in those forums. We may use your parent email address to seek further verifiable parental consent for the collection and use of any additional features such as sharing of content before the features are made available.<p>

          <h2>More about Non Personal Data</h2>

          <p>To help us provide you with the best service, we work with third party analytics providers Mixpanel and Crashlytics. Their respective Privacy Policies can be found at mixpanel.com/privacy and try.crashlytics.com/terms. These companies help us to understand your use of the site and apps. In association with them, we may collect your unique device identifier, IP address, mobile phone carrier, game progress, time spent playing, and achievements. This information is for internal use only and can’t be shared. It’s just for us to help us improve our services for you. We may use cookies and web beacons to help deliver and analyze our services (e.g., by counting the number of times a page or advert has been viewed).</p>

          <p>Eezy may also use third parties from time to time to deliver a service, such as payment processing, sending emails, infrastructure and IT services, or helping with customer or technical support. We only work with companies that follow this privacy policy and agree not to use your information for any other purposes. If you’d like more information on this, please contact us at privacy@kidrec.com.</p>

          <h2>A Word about What We Might Disclose</h2>

          <p>As you can see, we collect minimal personal data, and some nonpersonal data for internal use only or in conjunction with third parties to help us operate, analyze, and improve our sites and services. In addition, we may disclose your personal or nonpersonal information to additional parties if we believe we are required to by law, by a judicial proceeding, to protect Eezy’s rights and properties, or to investigate fraud, intellectual property infringement, and any other conduct that might be illegal or expose Eezy or a user of its services to legal liability. In addition, Eezy may disclose your information in the event of a change or proposed change in the ownership of the company; for example, a sale, a merger, or bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>Parents may disclose information about themselves by posting in the public forums on the site. Eezy is not responsible for what parents say and post in these sections.</p>

          <h2>Tracking</h2>

          <p>We use Google Analytics Advertising Features to better understand the use of our website for parents. These features include Remarketing, Impression reporting, integration with DoubleClick and Demographic & Interest reporting. They use cookies and anonymous identifiers to collect information and help target advertising. We do not combine this information with any personally identifiable information you may have submitted when signing up to a newsletter for example. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals; but, you can opt out of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. You can also configure your browser to accept or reject cookies. All browsers are different so go to the help section of your browser to find out how to do this.</p>

          <h2>Links</h2>

          <p>We may include links to third parties from our website or services. Eezy isn’t responsible for these companies and including a link to them doesn’t mean that Eezy endorses them. So be sure to check their privacy policies if you decide to visit them. And remember, your use of Eezy’s sites and services may also be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of other services that Eezy doesn’t control such as mobile application stores, mobile software platforms, online social media sites, or payment processors.</p>

          <h2>Security</h2>

          <p>Eezy uses generally accepted security measures and safeguards in an attempt to keep the data it collects secure and requires that the third parties it works with agree to do the same. The measures and safeguards include limiting access to the data to those persons who need it to complete their work for Eezy, using a fire-wall protected environment, and storing personal information in secure operating environments. That said, Eezy cannot and does not guarantee and does not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>

          <h2>Data Retention</h2>

          <p>User data is retained as long as it is necessary to provide the service. Data is deleted from our records when it is no longer needed within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

          <h2>How to update or remove your information</h2>
          <p>Eezy keeps your content for as long as necessary in providing its services. If you want to opt out of services, or review or delete your information, please contact us at privacy@kidrec.com.</p>

          <h2>Notice to California Residents:</h2>

          <p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by certain members of Eezy to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. With respect to these entities, this Privacy Policy applies only to their activities within the State of California. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@kidrec.com or write us:</p>
